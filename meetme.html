                After serving in the United States Navy for several years, Terrill decided it was time for him to explore a different career path. He previously worked in construction before joining the military which made the transition to the permitting industry fairly easy for him. After the transition, Terrill worked for two very well known expediting companies located in Norfolk, Virginia and the District of Columbia for a number of years. Those experiences acted as a catalyst in his pursuit of starting his own company. Terrill is very eager to help others reach their goals. Those include, but are not limited to, getting a permit, obtaining a business licence, or even doing extensive research for a project.
